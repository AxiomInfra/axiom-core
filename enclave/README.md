# Enclave (Experimental Preview)

This directory contains **experimental** enclave-related components for a possible v1.x
hardware-attested execution path. These components are **opt-in**, **non-production**,
and **not required** to use the v0.x Axiom Core SDK.

Scope notes:

- No v0.x guarantees are provided here.
- Simulator mode provides **no security guarantees**.
- APIs and behavior may change without notice.

Contents:

- `runner/` — native Rust runner preview for enclave execution and attestation.
